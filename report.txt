============================= ASSIGNMENT REPORT ============================
Assignment name is: Wildfire
My name is:         Munkh-Orgil Jargalsaikhan 

	[USE PLAIN TEXT]
	[INSERT ANSWERS AFTER EACH QUESTION AND ADD MORE LINES AS NEEDED.]
	[MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

===== In what cases does the program run correctly?  =================
- Works with all valid flags: -b1..100, -c1..100, -d1..100, -n0..100, -p0..10000, -s5..40
- Default run (no args): 10×10 grid, 50% trees, 10% burning, 30% catch, 25% neighbor
- Print mode (-pN): prints N+1 grids, stops early if fire dies
- Overlay mode: smooth animation, 0.75s delay, "Fires are out." at end
- Fire spreads to 8 neighbors, burns exactly 3 cycles: * * * .
- Same output every run thanks to srandom(41) + Fisher-Yates shuffle
- Invalid input: prints exact error + usage and quits

===== In what cases does the program fail and how?  ==================
- Bad values: -b0, -s3, -p-1 → shows correct error message + usage → exits
- Non-numbers: -babc → treated as invalid → error + exit
- No crashes or memory leaks — uses static arrays + small malloc in init

===== If applicable, what were the extra credit results?  ============
- No extra credit implemented

===== If applicable, describe how to run the extra credit.  ==========
- N/A

===== How much time did I spend on the project?  =====================
- About 17 hours total
  - 3h planning + reading spec
  - 5h core logic + fire spread
  - 3h command-line parsing + errors
  - 3h print/overlay modes
  - 2h testing + fixing burn duration
  - 1h docs + report

===== What did I learn?  =============================================
- How to use getopt() properly for CLI args
- Cellular automata: how neighbor rules work
- Must copy grid before update or fire spreads weirdly
- ANSI cursor control with display.c is cool
- Fixed seed (srandom(41)) makes testing easy
- #define and static arrays keep code clean
- Handling small formatting differences can break tests

===== What was easy in this assignment?  =============================
- Setting up the 2D grid with static arrays
- Printing the grid with printf
- Basic fire spread idea (if neighbor burning → maybe catch)

===== What gave me problems or troubles?  ============================
- Usage message newline mismatch in stderr output
- Burn duration tracking — needed burn_age[][]
- Overlay flicker — fixed with set_cur_pos()
- Variable typo (lighting_pct vs lightning_pct)
- Getting test harness to pass exact format checks

===== What would be the most important improvement for the project?  =
- Add color in overlay mode: green=Y, red=*, gray=.

===== What else would I have liked to do for this assignment?  =======
- Save animation to file (-o output.txt)
- Wind direction to bias fire spread
- Pause/resume with spacebar in overlay
